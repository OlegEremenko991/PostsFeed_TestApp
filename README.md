# Posts feed
This is a test task.
The app uses Realm to store your data and shows how many days passed after something happened in your life.

## Main requirements

1. Create a screen with posts feed
2. Load new posts when user scrolls to the last post
3. Add a button to sort posts (by date, by comments and by popularity)
4. All UI elements must be written in code, without storyboard (the main goal is to show basic information from JSON)
5. Open new screen when user taps on post and show some details there (date, author, text)
6. Only standard Apple libraries are allowed to use
